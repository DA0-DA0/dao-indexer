/// Asserts that two expressions are equal to each other (using [`PartialEq`]).

/// On panic, this macro will print the values of the expressions with their

/// Like [`assert!`], this macro has a second form, where a custom

/// # Examples
///
/// ```
/// let a = 3;
/// let b = 1 + 2;
/// assert_eq!(a, b);
///
/// assert_eq!(a, b, "we are testing addition with {} and {}", a, b);
/// ```
